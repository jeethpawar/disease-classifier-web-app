    About Us

<p>

This website utilizes Scikit Learnâ€™s Random Forest Classifier on a medical database in order to generate a model that links symptoms to diseases. 


Limitations:

Our machine-learning model is unfortunately limited by our dataset. A trained model will only ever be as good as the data which it is trained on. Our dataset consists of hundreds of thousands of linkages between symptoms and diseases and their occurrences  on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed</a> , one of the few thorough and available datasets we were able to obtain. After performing an 80/20 split on the data, we were granted an accuracy score of (fill in later), indicating that our model is able to correctly link symptoms to a disease (fill in later) percent of the time. But once again, our dataset inevitably has flaws that will affect our model and its accuracy. This tool should not be considered a replacement of a true medical diagnosis (as a complete patient profile is not present for evaluation) but rather simply a measure of probability of linkages between your own symptoms and potential maladies you may possess. It is highly likely that the model may not present your current condition and thus should be treated as a true diagnosis. It is highly encouraged that this model should not affect your decision to visit a medical professional.
